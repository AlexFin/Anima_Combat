0,Routine,20,Normal actions almost anyone can do without thinking ? like going up stairs two at a time or hearing a loud noise. The Game Master will usually not ask the player to perform an Ability Check on these actions except under unusual circumstances.
1,Easy,40,Actions we are all used to doing - like remembering a song. Even someone who knows nothing about the subject will usually be able to do this within a couple tries.
2,Moderate,80,These are actions that require a little bit of knowledge or experience to accomplish consistently ? like picking a simple lock or curing a bothersome cold.
3,Difficult,120,These are very problematic actions for an ordinary person. They require a good deal of ability or uncommon luck to perform ? such as scaling a wall unaided or doing circus-level juggling.
4,Very Difficult,140,This is the upper limit of difficulty a normal person can hope to surmount. Examples would be walking a high-wire or doing death-defying trapeze routines.
5,Absurd,180,Only the greatest champions or the incredibly gifted can acomplish such challenging tasks with any regularity. Quickly analyzing every possible move on a chess board is one example.
6,Almost Impossible,240,"Even the very best in the world find these actions very difficult, and they usually fail. Catching a fly with a pair of chopsticks while blindfolded might be one example."
7,Impossible,280,"These actions stand at the margin of what we call reality, but which, however miraculous or unbelievable, are at least physically conceivable. Dodging a bullet by calculating its trajectory is one example."
8,Inhuman,320,"These are actions that are beyond logic, such running 100 yards in two seconds, or scoring a 17 on 18 holes of golf. Mere ability added to a die roll will not suffice when it comes to these feats. It will be necessary for the character to have access to Inhuman Actions to do these things. "
9,Zen,440,"These are actions that are completely the scope of what we call reality ? like riding a beam of light. As with Inhuman tasks, mere ability will not enable Zen-level actions; the character will need
a supernatural capacity to perform them."
